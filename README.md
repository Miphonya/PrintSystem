# PrintSystem

PrintSystem comes in two versions, the GUI version which has a graphical user interface, and the CLI version which is terminal-only.

The latter is free to use within the limits of the GNU General Public License v2.0.

The software will likely receive updates in the future, but this is not guaranteed.
